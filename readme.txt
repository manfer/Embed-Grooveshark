This plugin allows you to embed grooveshark songs and playlists in your posts/pages/widgets with a shortcode.

== Description ==

The plugin that allowed to embed grooveshark widgets claims it is no more working and suggests some other alternatives.

I have not been able to find which is the plugin, if any, that adds the gigya shortcode. Maybe that's only something for
blogs hosted in wordpress.com.

Embedly looks good but not something I like so I decided to code a plugin to just embed grooveshark.
